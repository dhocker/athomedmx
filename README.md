## Build Environment

AtHomePowerlineServer is written in Python 2.7. A suitable development environment would use 
virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper to create a working virtual environment. 
The requirements.txt file can be used with pip to create the required virtual environment with all dependencies.

AtHomeDMX was developed using PyCharm CE. PyCharm CE is highly recommended. However, a good text editor 
of your choice is all that is really required.
