# DMX test script

# Notes
#   All keywords, names are case insensitive.
#   The script starts with the initialization/setup phase
#   which includes all of the statements up to the
#   loop statement.

# Test of import. Brings in definitions used below
import definitions.dmx

# Initial state (set channel value(s))
set tp64rgb on on on
set tp64mode rgb-mode
set tp64dimmer off
send

# This will run the program every day at 5:00pm for 5 hours
RunAt 17:01 0:01

# Each step runs for step-time 5.0
step default-fade-time default-step-time
    # Immediate changes
    set tp64rgb on off on
    set tp64dimmer on
    send
    # Values fade from their initial to target values over fadetime
    fade tp64rgb on on off
step-end

# Wait for end of run time
step 10.0 60.0
step-end

# If there is no loop statement, the script ends when there
# are no more statements.

# In this case we should go back to the RunAt statement.
# It will keep that up until the RunAt time passes.
